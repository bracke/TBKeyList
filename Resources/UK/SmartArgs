 Description

  This package is designed to simplify the use of command 
  line arguments for controlling a program. The built in
  Ada facilities for command line argument processing are 
  very basic. This package provide a higher level facility
  for dealing with command lines. It is similar in purpose to GNU
  getopts however if one is expecting this package to act
  in the same manner they will be disappointed. 

  The concept that this package uses is that client programs
  make a series of calls to "create" the arguments that
  the program can process. Once all of the parameters
  are registered locally with this package then a simple
  unified help output can be created and the client program
  can refer to the command line arguments in a more meaningful
  manner than Ada.Command_Line.Argument(4);

Note that this package is distributed under the terms of what
is typically referred to as that GNAT Modified GPL.

exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
