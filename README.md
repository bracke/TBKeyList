# TBKeyList
TBKeyList creates a list of the keyboard shortcuts defined in a toolbox resource file (&fae). It also adds information about the window containing the shortcut, which object is shown and what event is raised when the shortcut is used.
The layout of the created list is defined in templates and can be changed easily.

NOTE: This is a RISC OS app.
